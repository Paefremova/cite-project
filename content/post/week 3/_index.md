## 🌞 Activity — A Way of Life

I try not to sit still every day: morning walks, trips around the Moscow Central Circle (already my favorite habit!), short routes through cozy alleys, or sudden stops in parks with a book. It not only gives me a boost of energy but also inspires me.

I notice how regular walks help me not only physically but mentally. My brain “air-dries,” new ideas come, and even a tired mind seems to come alive.

## 😴 How to Set a Good Sleep Routine

Here’s what really helps me get enough sleep and not lose energy:

- ⏰ **Double alarm**: one for waking up and one for going to sleep
- 📵 **Screen detox** one hour before sleep (replace it with a book or notebook)
- 🧘‍♀️ **The "3 Blocks" technique**:
  1. 60 minutes before bed — soft light, no screens
  2. 30 minutes before — breathing exercises or meditation
  3. 10 minutes before — short gratitude journaling

Small habits work wonders: my mood improved, my attention became more stable, and the days became more fulfilling but not exhausting.

## 📚 Study: How to Study Smarter, Not Longer

Here’s my study formula:

A[Reading] --> B[Note-taking]
B --> C[Rephrasing out loud]
C --> D[Self-testing]
D --> E[Review after 1 day]
E --> F[Review after 1 week]
```
## 🔎 Comments on Techniques

- **Feynman Technique** — helps identify weak spots in understanding. If you can’t explain it simply, you haven’t understood it.
- **Spaced Repetition** — based on Ebbinghaus’s forgetting curve. You review right before forgetting it — and remember it for much longer.
- **Pomodoro** — protects against burnout. After 4 "Pomodoros," you can tackle a tough topic.
- **Mind Maps** — perfect for logic and associations. Especially useful for theory.

## 🌳 Beautiful and Hidden Parks in Moscow

These parks won't have crowds of tourists, but they’ll offer plenty of space, trees, and silence.

### 🌲 Lianozovsky Park
- **Location**: North Moscow  
- **Features**: Forest atmosphere, wide paths, few people  
- **Tip**: Perfect for a morning coffee and reading under the trees

### 🌳 Kuskovo Forest Park
- **Location**: East Moscow, Veshnyaki district  
- **Features**: Estate, old pond, real forest  
- **Tip**: Great for walking while listening to podcasts or recording voice notes

### 🌿 Timiryazevsky Forest
- **Location**: Near the "Timiryazevskaya" platform  
- **Features**: Wild trails, squirrels, pine scent  
- **Tip**: Great for solitude, you can even study there

### 🍃 Bitsevsky Forest
- **Location**: South Moscow  
- **Features**: Really feels like a forest, not a park. Paths, ravines, streams  
- **Tip**: If you're tired of everything — just walk along the path and breathe

## 💬 Conclusion

The week was busy, but balanced: study, activity, walks, a bit of rest — everything in its place. I realized that the most important thing is **not the amount of things you do, but how you feel during the process**.

Stay active but take care of yourself 💚
