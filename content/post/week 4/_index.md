The past seven days felt like **one long sprint peppered with aha‑moments**.

### 🎨 SFML Geometry Comes Alive

I finally wired up my **hierarchy of geometric shapes** in SFML—think circles morphing into triangles, all with virtual inheritance purring under the hood. Seeing the scene run at 60 FPS was the chef’s kiss.

### 🛡️ C++ Vect & Matrix — Defense Mode On

Next up: polishing slides for the big **Technology Programming lab defense**. I’ve been dissecting every constructor, pointer, and overloaded operator so I can field any curveball.

> **Mini‑win:** rewrote all console outputs to Russian and renamed every variable to something readable. Feels good!

### 🧩 Scholarship Game Brainstorm

Between compile runs, I sketched mechanics for an **interactive scholarship workshop**: card decks for types of aid, improv scenes about budgeting, and a scoreboard to keep first‑years engaged.

### 🌱 Sanity Breaks

* **Walks around the MCC** loop to clear my head.
* Evening **stretch sessions** so my shoulders forgive the laptop hunch.
* A strict **“lights‑out‑by‑midnight”** rule—honestly the best debugging tool.

### ✔ Focused Sprints

I’m timing study blocks with a 45 min / 10 min rhythm. Keeps fatigue away and IDE tabs under control.

### ✔ Snack Stack

* **Орехи** for quick brain fuel.
* **Гречка** + veggies = slow carbs that last through a coding marathon.
* Limiting coffee to **2 cups**—after that it’s herbal tea or bust.

### ✔ Move It, Keep It Fun

Short MCC rides double as sightseeing and micro‑workouts (hello, standing carriages!). Fresh air resets my focus better than any to‑do app.
