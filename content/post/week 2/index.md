Lately, I've been spending **as much time outdoors as possible**—walking, exploring parks, and riding the **Moscow Central Circle**. These trips are incredibly relaxing and a great way to escape the hustle and bustle.  

Of course, **studying never stops**: working on **computer architecture labs**, diving into **programming fundamentals**, and tackling **mathematical analysis** and **logic**—my brain is definitely getting a workout! 📚  

### 📖 The Benefits of a Balanced Study Load  
One great thing about my studies is that the workload is **not overwhelming**. This allows me to **fully grasp the material**, which is presented in a clear and engaging way. There's also **plenty of time for self-development**—whether it's learning additional skills, exploring new interests, or looking for part-time job opportunities. This balance makes studying much more enjoyable and effective.  

But the **highlight of the week** was the **Oleg LSP concert**! 🎤🔥 Favorite songs, an amazing atmosphere, and tons of emotions—I’m fully recharged and ready for new challenges.

### ✔ Sleep is a Superpower 😴  
No matter how much you have to do, **sleep should be a priority**. Chronic sleep deprivation lowers concentration, increases irritability, and weakens the immune system. **7-9 hours of sleep** is key to a productive day and a good mood.

🔹 **Slow carbs** (whole grains, vegetables) provide lasting energy without sugar crashes.  
🔹 **Healthy fats** (avocado, nuts, olive oil) support brain function.  
❌ **Too much fast food and sweets**—a quick energy boost, followed by a crash and fatigue. Moderation is key!
