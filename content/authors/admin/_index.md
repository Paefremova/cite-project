## About Me

I am Polina, a kind and positive girl. My life is always connected with humor. The clown is a smiley face that
perfectly describes my condition.
I consider my loved ones to be very important to me, and I really appreciate communication. I am quite
purposeful, I can also mention the strength of the spirit.
Fighting and searching, finding and not giving up is my motto in life.
